Connecting Maven dependencies: Make sure that your project has all the necessary dependencies configured for JUnit and AEM, including JUnit 5, Sling Testing, and other libraries, if required.

Creating JUnit tests to test the functionality of Java code associated with Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) requires proper configuration of the environment for testing AEM components and services.
